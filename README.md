more, this application is known for tracking your time or keeping your time. this application is called the time managemnet application, meaning you as the user can manage your time effectilvely by simply making 
use of this application as it calculates your time for you meaning you dont need to do the calculations in your head, just simply fill out details on the wpf and the system will do its work effectively.
